# âœ… Ingestion System Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment (Local Testing)

- [ ] Read `INGESTION_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` completely
- [ ] Verify `app/config.py` has new tier settings
- [ ] Verify `app/workers/tiered_scheduler.py` exists
- [ ] Run local test:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python -m app.workers.tiered_scheduler
  ```
- [ ] Watch for 15-20 seconds, verify output shows:
  ```
  âœ… Scheduler configured with 5 tiers
  ðŸ”„ Running initial ingestion...
  âš¡ TIER 1: X.Xs (Y articles)
  ```
- [ ] Stop with Ctrl+C (should exit cleanly)

## Pre-Deployment (Code Review)

- [ ] Check `app/main.py` - note which scheduler it currently uses
- [ ] Verify database is working (`sqlite:///` or PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Verify API keys in `.env` (or Railway variables):
  - [ ] `NEWSAPI_KEY` (if using NewsAPI)
  - [ ] `GOOGLE_FACTCHECK_API_KEY` (if fact-checking enabled)
  - [ ] `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (for alerts, optional)

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Keep Old System (Recommended for first release)

This allows A/B testing before full migration.

**In `app/main.py`:**
```python
# Current scheduler entry point - keep unchanged
# The app will continue using old scheduler.py
```

**When ready to switch:**
```python
# Change this line:
# from app.workers.scheduler import main as scheduler_main
# To:
from app.workers.tiered_scheduler import main as scheduler_main
```

Then redeploy.

### Option B: Full Migration (if confident)

1. **Update `app/main.py`:**
   ```python
   # Replace:
   from app.workers.scheduler import main as scheduler_main

   # With:
   from app.workers.tiered_scheduler import main as scheduler_main
   ```

2. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add app/config.py app/workers/tiered_scheduler.py app/main.py
   git commit -m "Implement 5-tier optimized ingestion pipeline"
   git push
   ```

3. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Railway detects push
   - Rebuilds with new scheduler
   - Monitor logs for TIER outputs

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Hour 1 (Verify Basic Function)
- [ ] Backend logs show TIER 1 completing
- [ ] No exceptions in logs
- [ ] Frontend loads and shows data
- [ ] Stats page works

### Hour 2-4 (Verify All Tiers)
- [ ] See TIER 1 output multiple times
- [ ] See TIER 2 output at least once
- [ ] See TIER 3 output at least once (at 60-min mark)
- [ ] No memory spikes or crashes
- [ ] Database growing at normal rate

### Day 1 (Comprehensive Verification)
- [ ] All tiers ran successfully
- [ ] No error messages in logs
- [ ] TIER 4 ran (6x during day)
- [ ] Data quality looks good
- [ ] Response times normal

### Week 1 (Production Monitoring)
- [ ] Compare metrics vs old system:
  - [ ] Memory usage lower?
  - [ ] API costs lower?
  - [ ] Response times faster?
  - [ ] News freshness improved?
- [ ] Monitor alert frequency (should be same or better)
- [ ] Check database size growth (should be slower)

## Rollback Instructions

If anything goes wrong, rollback is simple:

```bash
# In app/main.py, revert one line:
# from app.workers.tiered_scheduler import main as scheduler_main
# Back to:
from app.workers.scheduler import main as scheduler_main

# Commit and push
git add app/main.py
git commit -m "Rollback to previous ingestion scheduler"
git push

# Railway auto-redeploys, old system resumes
```

The old `app/workers/scheduler.py` is unchanged, so rollback is instantaneous.

## Configuration Adjustments

### If Memory Usage is Still High

```python
# app/config.py - reduce excerpt processing
max_excerpts_per_run = 5  # was 8
conflict_reevaluation_hours = 4  # was 6
tier3_interval = 90  # was 60
```

### If Breaking News Response is Still Slow

```python
# app/config.py - more aggressive fetching
tier1_interval_peak = 8  # was 10
tier1_interval_offpeak = 15  # was 20
```

### If Fact-Checking is Timing Out

```python
# app/config.py - slower but reliable
max_fact_check_workers = 1  # was 2
fact_check_batch_size = 20  # was 30
tier4_interval = 300  # was 240 (every 5h not 4h)
```

### If Railway Keep-Alive Issues

Railway free tier may have issues if TIER 3/4 run too long:

```python
# app/config.py - lighter load
max_excerpts_per_run = 3  # Very conservative
tier3_interval = 120  # Every 2 hours not 1
tier4_interval = 480  # Every 8 hours not 4
```

## Success Criteria

System is working well if:

- âœ… All tiers complete within their intervals
- âœ… Memory never exceeds 300MB
- âœ… No error logs (warnings OK)
- âœ… Frontend displays fresh data
- âœ… TIER 4 fact-checking works (6x per day)
- âœ… New articles appear within 10-30 min

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Recent Logs (Railway)
```bash
# In Railway dashboard or CLI:
railway logs --follow
```

### Watch TIER Metrics
Look for lines like:
```
âš¡ TIER 1: 3.2s (145 items)
ðŸ“° TIER 2: 42.1s (298 items, 4 events, 12 dups)
ðŸ§  TIER 3: 68.5s (8 re-eval, 2 dev, 3 conflict)
ðŸ”¬ TIER 4: 85.3s (28 checked, 1 flagged)
ðŸ§¹ TIER 5: 15.2s (1247 deleted)
```

### Database Health
```bash
# Check article count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles;

# Check event count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;

# Check oldest article
SELECT MIN(ingested_at) FROM articles;
```

## Estimated Improvements

After running for 24 hours, you should see:

| Metric | Old | New | Improvement |
|--------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Memory peak | 500MB | 200MB | 60% â†“ |
| API calls (fact-check) | 4,100/day | 180/day | 95% â†“ |
| Breaking news latency | 30 min | 10 min | 66% â†“ |
| Database size growth | 500MB/month | 350MB/month | 30% â†“ |

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check logs first - look for error messages
2. Verify all config values in `app/config.py`
3. Ensure API keys are set (NewsAPI, Fact-Check, Discord)
4. Review `INGESTION_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section
5. Rollback if needed (single line change in `app/main.py`)

Good luck! ðŸš€
