# Truth Layer Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist when deploying to production.

## Pre-Deployment

### Code Preparation
- [ ] All tests passing locally (`make test`)
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Latest changes committed to GitHub
- [ ] Local system works with `make dev`

### Configuration
- [ ] Chose cloud platform (Render/Railway/DigitalOcean)
- [ ] Registered domain OR using free subdomain
- [ ] Created production environment variables
- [ ] Configured DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS with production domain
- [ ] Added optional API keys (NewsAPI, Mediastack)

### Platform Setup
- [ ] Account created on chosen platform
- [ ] Payment method added (if required)
- [ ] GitHub repository connected
- [ ] PostgreSQL database provisioned

---

## Deployment Steps

### Database
- [ ] PostgreSQL database created
- [ ] Connection string copied
- [ ] Database accessible from services
- [ ] Tables auto-create on first backend start

### Backend Service
- [ ] Service created with correct Dockerfile path
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Health check path set to `/health/ready`
- [ ] Service deployed successfully
- [ ] Logs show "Database initialized"
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200: `curl https://backend-url/health`

### Worker Service
- [ ] Background worker service created
- [ ] Start command: `python -m app.workers.scheduler`
- [ ] Environment variables match backend
- [ ] Service running
- [ ] Logs show "Worker started"
- [ ] First ingestion cycle completed (check logs)

### Frontend Service
- [ ] Service created with correct Dockerfile path
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL points to backend
- [ ] Service deployed successfully
- [ ] Can access UI in browser
- [ ] No console errors (check browser DevTools)

---

## Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Homepage shows hero section: "Welcome, Seekers of Knowledge"
- [ ] Navigation works (Confirmed, Developing, Underreported, Stats)
- [ ] Events display correctly (may be empty initially)
- [ ] Stats page shows system metrics
- [ ] API documentation accessible: `/docs`
- [ ] RSS feed works: `/feeds/verified.xml`

### Backend Health
- [ ] `/health` returns status: "healthy"
- [ ] `/health/live` returns status: "alive"
- [ ] `/health/ready` returns status: "ready"
- [ ] `/events` returns valid JSON
- [ ] `/events/stats/summary` shows statistics

### Worker Health
- [ ] Worker logs show ingestion cycles every 15 minutes
- [ ] Articles being fetched (check logs for "âœ… GDELT", "âœ… RSS", etc.)
- [ ] Events being created
- [ ] Scoring running
- [ ] No repeated errors in logs

### Data Pipeline
- [ ] Wait 15 minutes for first cycle
- [ ] Check `/health` - total_articles should increase
- [ ] Check `/events?status=all` - should have events
- [ ] Verify events have sources
- [ ] Check underreported detection working

---

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] UptimeRobot monitor added (prevents free tier sleep)
- [ ] Discord webhook working (if configured)
- [ ] Error tracking setup (Sentry, optional)
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for free tier expiration

### Performance
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 500ms
- [ ] No memory leaks (monitor for 24 hours)
- [ ] Database size reasonable (<100MB initially)

### Security
- [ ] HTTPS working (green padlock)
- [ ] HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] CORS only allows your domain
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with live URL
- [ ] Add deployment date to docs
- [ ] Document any platform-specific quirks
- [ ] Create runbook for operations

---

## 24-Hour Monitoring

### Hour 1
- [ ] All services responding
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] First ingestion cycle completed

### Hour 6
- [ ] Worker ran 24 ingestion cycles (every 15 min Ã— 24 = 6 hours)
- [ ] Events accumulating
- [ ] No database connection errors
- [ ] Memory usage stable

### Hour 24
- [ ] System stable
- [ ] Data retention working (30-day cleanup)
- [ ] API response times consistent
- [ ] No unexpected costs

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Check Logs**: Platform dashboard â†’ Service â†’ Logs
2. **Common Issues**:
   - Database URL wrong â†’ Fix in env vars, redeploy
   - CORS error â†’ Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS
   - Build failure â†’ Check Dockerfile paths

3. **Emergency Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   # Platform auto-deploys previous version
   ```

4. **Keep Local Running**: Your localhost version still works!

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

âœ… Public URL accessible from any device/network  
âœ… HTTPS enabled with valid certificate  
âœ… All pages load without errors  
âœ… Worker ingesting every 15 minutes  
âœ… Events appearing and being scored  
âœ… No errors in logs after 24 hours  
âœ… Monitoring alerts configured  
âœ… Automatic deployments working on git push  

**Congratulations! Truth Layer is now live for the world! ðŸŽ‰**

---

## Maintenance

### Daily
- [ ] Check health endpoint
- [ ] Review error logs

### Weekly
- [ ] Verify data ingestion continuing
- [ ] Check database size
- [ ] Review performance metrics

### Monthly
- [ ] Verify backups working
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Review costs vs budget
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed
