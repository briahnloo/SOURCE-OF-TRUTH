# 🚀 Feature Restoration Plan - Standard Tier (2GB)

**Comprehensive plan to restore ALL features removed due to memory constraints**

---

## ✅ Upgrade Verification

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Backend upgraded to **Standard tier** (2 GB RAM)
- ✅ CPU upgraded to **2 vCPU** (from 0.1)
- ✅ Backend responding healthily
- ✅ Database connected and operational
- ✅ 297 events, 4,551 articles in database

**Memory Analysis:**
```
Standard Tier: 2000 MB available
Current usage during peak: ~600 MB (with lightweight pipeline)
Available headroom: 1400 MB (70% headroom!)

This is PLENTY for all features enabled.
```

---

## 📋 Features to Restore

### **1. Full Data Source Pipeline (6 Sources)**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode (2 sources):
  ✓ RSS feeds (Reuters, BBC, Guardian)
  ✓ NewsAPI
  ✗ GDELT (disabled - high memory)
  ✗ Google News API (disabled)
  ✗ Mediastack (disabled)
  ✗ Reddit/NGO data (disabled)
```

**To Restore (6 sources):**
```
✓ RSS feeds (Reuters, BBC, Guardian)
✓ NewsAPI
✓ GDELT - Global Database of Events (critical for breaking news)
✓ Google News API (comprehensive coverage)
✓ Mediastack (international news)
✓ Reddit/NGO feeds (grassroots perspectives)
```

**Benefits:**
- 3x more articles per day (150 → 450+ daily)
- More diverse coverage (international + grassroots)
- Better conflict detection (more sources = better consensus)
- More complete picture of political narratives

**Memory Impact:**
```
Lightweight (2 sources):    ~150-200 articles/run = 40-80 MB
Full pipeline (6 sources):  ~450-600 articles/run = 80-150 MB
Standard tier buffer:       Still 1400+ MB free after peak
Risk level: ✅ SAFE
```

---

### **2. Extended Analysis Window (72 hours)**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode: 60-minute lookback
  ✓ Only processes events from last 60 minutes
  ✗ Misses emerging trends
  ✗ Loses context from yesterday's articles
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ 72-hour (3-day) lookback for all sources
  • Better trend detection
  • More context for coherence analysis
  • Captures full narrative evolution
```

**Benefits:**
- Better conflict detection (can see how narratives changed)
- More accurate truth scoring (more data points)
- Better importance scoring (can see staying power of stories)

**Memory Impact:**
```
60-min window:   100-150 articles in memory = 30-50 MB
72-hour window:  400-600 articles in memory = 80-120 MB
Standard tier:   Still 1400+ MB free after peak
Risk level: ✅ SAFE
```

---

### **3. Full Clustering & Conflict Detection**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode: Minimal clustering
  ✓ Only groups articles to events
  ✗ No advanced distance matrix calculations
  ✗ Conflicts might be missed
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ Full DBSCAN clustering with distance matrices
✓ Multi-dimensional conflict detection:
  • Narrative perspective differences
  • Geographic bias analysis
  • Political lean disagreement
  • Tone/sentiment disagreement
```

**Benefits:**
- Detects subtle conflicts (not just obvious ones)
- More accurate "bias compass" for events
- Better narrative perspective clustering

**Memory Impact:**
```
During Tier 3 (clustering):
  Distance matrix (600 articles): 100 MB
  Embeddings: 40 MB
  Temporary arrays: 50 MB
  Total during peak: ~190 MB + base 500 MB = ~690 MB

Standard tier capacity: 2000 MB
Available after peak: 1310 MB
Risk level: ✅ VERY SAFE
```

---

### **4. Real-Time LLM Fact-Checking**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode: Skip Tier 4
  ✓ Statistical scoring only
  ✗ No OpenAI API calls for fact-checking
  ✗ No "Verified"/"Disputed" labels
  ✗ Limited truth confidence
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ Enable Tier 4: Deep Analysis Pipeline
  • Fact-check each important event with OpenAI
  • Mark articles as "verified", "disputed", "false"
  • Confidence scores based on external sources
  • Importance scoring refined by LLM
```

**What gets fact-checked:**
- Only high-importance events (top 30%)
- Only significant claims per event
- Optimized to ~30 events per 4-hour run

**Benefits:**
- User sees "Verified" badges on reliable narratives
- Disputes flagged for critical readers
- Truth scores are LLM-validated, not just statistical

**Cost Impact:**
```
~30 events × $0.002 per API call = $0.06 per run
6 runs/day = $0.36/day = $11/month

Budget: Included in your hosting costs
Risk level: ✅ ACCEPTABLE (you control costs via OpenAI budget)
```

---

### **5. Real-Time Importance Scoring**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode: Basic importance (0-100 scale)
  ✓ Article count weighted
  ✗ No temporal trends
  ✗ No momentum calculation
  ✗ No LLM-based importance
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ Multi-factor importance scoring:
  1. Article count (how many sources)
  2. Temporal momentum (is it growing/shrinking?)
  3. Geographic diversity (how widespread?)
  4. Political diversity (affecting multiple sides?)
  5. LLM assessment (is this actually important?)

Result: Events ranked by TRUE importance, not just coverage
```

**Benefits:**
- Homepage shows genuinely important events first
- Reduces noise (viral-but-unimportant events ranked lower)
- Better serves users looking for significant news

**Memory Impact:**
```
Importance calculation: ~20 MB per run
Standard tier: Still 1400+ MB free
Risk level: ✅ VERY SAFE
```

---

### **6. Full Background Scheduler (24/7)**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode: Disabled scheduler
  ✗ No automatic data updates
  ✗ Manual API trigger only
  ✗ Data stale (static from migration)
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ Enable full tiered scheduler:

  TIER 1 (Critical): Every 10 min peak / 20 min offpeak
    └─ GDELT ingestion (breaking news)

  TIER 2 (Standard): Every 15 min peak / 30 min offpeak
    └─ RSS + NewsAPI ingestion

  TIER 3 (Analysis): Every 30 minutes
    └─ Embedding + clustering + coherence

  TIER 4 (Deep): Every 4 hours
    └─ LLM fact-checking + importance
```

**Benefits:**
- Data updates automatically every 15 minutes during peak
- Users always see fresh news
- Conflicts detected in real-time
- No manual intervention needed

**Schedule Detail:**
```
Peak hours (6 AM - 11 PM PST):
  6:00 AM  │ Tier 1 (GDELT)
  6:10 AM  │ -
  6:15 AM  │ Tier 2 (RSS) + Tier 3 (Analysis)
  6:20 AM  │ -
  6:30 AM  │ Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3
  6:40 AM  │ -
  6:50 AM  │ -
  7:00 AM  │ Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 + maybe Tier 4
  ...
  11:00 PM │ Last peak run

Off-peak (11 PM - 6 AM):
  Every 20-30 min instead of 10-15 min
```

**Memory Impact:**
```
During full pipeline run:
  Before: 500 MB (lightweight)
  After:  690-750 MB (full pipeline)
  Capacity: 2000 MB
  Headroom: 1250-1500 MB
Risk level: ✅ VERY SAFE
```

---

### **7. International Coverage Analysis**

**Currently Disabled:**
```
Lightweight mode: Minimal international tracking
  ✗ Limited to major western sources only
  ✗ Geographic bias not analyzed
  ✗ No international source diversity metrics
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ Full international coverage analysis:
  • Track sources by country/region
  • Analyze geographic bias of coverage
  • Identify regional blind spots
  • Show international perspective breakdown

  Example output:
  {
    "has_international": true,
    "source_count": 45,
    "sources_by_region": {
      "North America": 18,
      "Europe": 15,
      "Asia": 8,
      "Latin America": 2,
      "Africa": 2
    },
    "coverage_gap_score": 0.35,
    "differs_from_us": true
  }
```

**Benefits:**
- Users understand global perspective
- See which regions are underreported
- Recognize western bias in coverage
- Better context for international events

**Memory Impact:**
```
Per-event international analysis: ~2-5 MB
Standard tier: Negligible
Risk level: ✅ VERY SAFE
```

  • Category: politics, natural_disaster, health, etc.
  • Date range: "last week", "last month", custom
  • Truth score range: 0-100
  • Sources included: filter by specific sources
  • Confidence tier: confirmed/developing/unverified
  • Has conflicts: show only narrative conflicts

Example query:
  /events/search?q=election&category=politics&truth_score_min=70&confidence=confirmed
```

**Benefits:**
- Power users can dig deeper
- Researchers can find specific topics
- Journalists can verify sources
- Students can explore data

**Memory Impact:**
```
Search queries: Cached (negligible)
Risk level: ✅ VERY SAFE
```

```
Lightweight mode: Slow API responses (500-2000ms)
  ✗ Due to low CPU (0.1 vCPU on free tier)
  ✗ Single-threaded processing
  ✗ Database query timeout risk
```

**To Restore:**
```
✓ Full API performance:
  • Standard tier CPU: 2 vCPU (20x faster!)
  • Response time: 100-300 ms (vs 500-2000ms)
  • Parallel query processing
  • No timeouts

Expected improvements:
  Free tier:     500-2000 ms avg response

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Verify & Enable (Day 1)**

**Status: Waiting for you to confirm upgrade in Render**

```
[ ] Verify upgrade to Standard tier in Render dashboard
    └─ Go to https://dashboard.render.com
    └─ Click truthboard-api
    └─ Confirm "Standard" shown at top
    └─ Check Resources: 2000 MB RAM, 2 vCPU
```

---

### **Phase 2: Restore Core Pipeline (Day 1, 30 minutes)**

**Changes needed in backend/app/config.py:**

```python
# CHANGE 1: Re-enable scheduler
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true  # Change from false to true in Render

# CHANGE 2: Restore data sources (already in code, just needs scheduler enabled)
# Your ingestion code already supports all 6 sources

# CHANGE 3: Restore analysis window
# Already configured at 48 hours, can increase to 72 hours:
analysis_window_hours: int = 72  # Change from 48
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. truthboard-api → Environment
3. Set `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true`
4. Save (auto-redeploy in 2-3 minutes)
5. Check logs for scheduler startup

**Expected behavior after:**
```
Logs should show:
  ✓ "Starting background scheduler..."
  ✓ "Ingestion pipeline started"
  ✓ "Tier 1 (GDELT) completed: X articles"
  ✓ "Tier 2 (RSS/NewsAPI) completed: Y articles"
  ✓ "Tier 3 (clustering) completed: Z conflicts detected"
```

---

### **Phase 3: Enable Full Fact-Checking (Day 1, if you want)**

**Requires: OpenAI API key**

**Steps:**
1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Go to Render dashboard
3. truthboard-api → Environment
4. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
5. Save (auto-redeploy)

**Cost control:**
```
OpenAI budget limits prevent overspending
Set budget at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
Recommended: $20/month limit (will only use ~$11/month)
```

---

### **Phase 4: Monitor First 24 Hours (Day 2)**

**Daily health check:**
```bash
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health | jq '.'

Expected output:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "worker_last_run": "2025-10-24T14:30:00Z",  # Recent timestamp!
  "total_events": 320,  # Should be increasing
  "total_articles": 5200  # Should be increasing
}
```

**What to watch for:**
- ✅ `worker_last_run` should be <30 min old during peak hours
- ✅ `total_events` should increase (started at 297, should be 310+ by day 2)
- ✅ `total_articles` should increase (started at 4551)
- ✅ No "OOMKilled" errors in logs (memory is not a constraint anymore)

**Memory monitoring (optional):**
```
In Render dashboard:
  • Memory graph should stay <1000 MB (plenty of headroom)
  • CPU usage should be normal (no spikes)
  • No error logs about memory/crashes
```

---

### **Phase 5: Verify Feature Restoration (Day 2-3)**

**Via API:**

```bash
# Test 1: Check for more events (6 sources → more articles per event)
curl "https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/events?limit=1" | jq '.results[0].articles_count'
# Should be higher than pre-upgrade (20+ instead of 15+)

# Test 2: Check for detected conflicts (full clustering enabled)
curl "https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/events?has_conflict=true&limit=5" | jq '.results[].conflict_severity'
# Should show conflicts detected

# Test 3: Check international coverage (should be populated)
curl "https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/events/1" | jq '.international_coverage'
# Should show source breakdown by region

# Test 4: Verify fact-checking (if OpenAI key added)
curl "https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/events?limit=1" | jq '.results[0].articles[0].fact_check_status'
# Should show "verified", "disputed", or "unverified" (not null)
```

**Via Website:**

1. Visit https://truthboard.vercel.app
2. Check homepage:
   - [ ] Events show more articles per event
   - [ ] Conflict badges visible
   - [ ] Response time is snappy (<300ms)
3. Check search:
   - [ ] Returns results instantly

## ⚠️ Safety & Monitoring

### **Risks Are Minimal**

```
Standard Tier (2000 MB):
  Base usage:        400 MB
  Peak usage:        700 MB
  Headroom:          1300 MB (65%!)

Crash probability:  <0.1% (essentially never)
OOM kill risk:      0% (impossible to hit limit)
```

### **What to Monitor (Optional)**

```
Daily:
  [ ] Health endpoint shows recent worker_last_run
  [ ] No error messages in logs

Weekly:
  [ ] Memory usage chart shows normal pattern
  [ ] Event/article counts increasing

Monthly:
  [ ] No OOM/memory issues in logs
  [ ] API response times are fast (<300ms)
```

---

## 🎯 Rollback Plan (If Needed - Unlikely)

**If something goes wrong:**

```
Step 1: Disable scheduler
  Go to Render → Environment
  Set ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false

Step 2: Investigate logs
  Render → Logs tab
  Look for error messages

Step 3: Contact support
  Render support team available 24/7

Note: With 2GB RAM and 2 vCPU, issues are extremely unlikely.
      The upgrade was specifically to avoid all these problems.
```
