# Free Tier Viability Analysis - The Truthboard

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT: YES, but with significant constraints** (75% confidence)

The Truthboard **CAN** run on free tiers (Vercel + Render) with careful configuration, but operates at the absolute edge of memory limits. Success depends on lightweight scheduler mode, keep-alive monitoring, and acceptance of performance trade-offs.

## Memory Analysis: The Critical Bottleneck

### Backend Memory Breakdown

```
Available: 512 MB (Render free tier)

Breakdown:
  Base Framework           : 130-190 MB  (FastAPI, uvicorn, SQLAlchemy)
  ML Models               : 120-180 MB  (sentence-transformers + spaCy)
  Runtime Processing      :  50-100 MB  (cache, connection pool, arrays)
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Normal Operation        : 300-470 MB  ✅ SAFE

  Peak During Pipeline    : 420-600 MB  ⚠️ AT/EXCEEDS LIMIT
```

### What Uses the Most Memory

1. **sentence-transformers (80-100MB)** - Embedding model
   - Cannot remove (core feature)
   - Already uses efficient model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

2. **spaCy (40-60MB)** - NLP model
   - Cannot remove (entity extraction)

3. **Clustering algorithm (80-150MB peak)** - DBSCAN + distance matrices
   - Only runs during background pipeline
   - Disabled on free tier (uses lightweight scheduler)

### Memory Under Different Scenarios

```
SCENARIO 1: Low Traffic (1-10 users/day)
  Memory: 350-400 MB steady state
  Verdict: ✅ EXCELLENT - No issues

SCENARIO 2: Moderate Traffic (50-100 users/day)
  Memory: 380-450 MB steady, 480 MB spikes
  Verdict: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE - Monitor closely

SCENARIO 3: High Traffic (500+ users/day)
  Memory: 450-600 MB (OOM risk)
  Verdict: 🚨 UPGRADE REQUIRED

SCENARIO 4: During Clustering Pipeline
  Memory: 420-600 MB peak
  Verdict: ⚠️ BORDERLINE - Works with lightweight mode
```

## What Free Tier Limitations Mean for Users

### Auto-Sleep (Every 15 Minutes of Inactivity)

**Problem**: Render free tier stops after 15 min idle
```
User visits page at 2:00 PM
Service runs, processes request
Service falls asleep at 2:15 PM (idle)

User visits page at 2:20 PM
Request hits sleeping service
Service wakes up: 30-60 seconds
Page loads slowly
```

**Solution**: UptimeRobot pings API every 14 minutes
- Keeps service awake 24/7
- Free tier available
- 5 minute setup

### Limited Data Sources

**Current (Full Paid Mode)**: 6 sources
- RSS feeds (Reuters, BBC, Guardian)
- Google News API
- GDELT database
- Mediastack
- Reddit / NGO data
- Social media

**Free Tier (Lightweight)**: 2 sources only
- RSS feeds
- NewsAPI
- Reduced lookback window (60 min vs full)
- No fact-checking
- No conflict re-analysis

**User Impact**: Less comprehensive coverage, fewer articles per day
- Still functional for MVP
- Acceptable for demo/proof-of-concept

### Performance (Slower, But Acceptable)

**API Response Times**:
```
Normal operation:      200-500 ms  ✅ OK
Moderate traffic:      500-2000 ms ⚠️ Noticeable but OK
High traffic:          2-5 seconds 🚨 Too slow
During pipeline:       5-15 seconds ⚠️ Visible delay
```

**Page Load Times**:
```
Homepage:              1-2 seconds ✅ OK
Search:                1-3 seconds ✅ OK
Stats:                 1-2 seconds ✅ OK
First request after sleep: 30-60 seconds ⚠️ Cold start
```

## Database: Surprisingly Robust

### Storage (1 GB Free)

**Current usage**: ~30 MB
**Growth rate**: ~5-10 MB per year

```
Timeline        Events  Storage  % of 1GB
─────────────────────────────────────────
1 month         100     25 MB    2.5%
3 months        300     27 MB    2.7%
1 year          1,200   35 MB    3.5%
5 years         6,000   60 MB    6%
10 years        12,000  85 MB    8.5%
```

**Verdict**: ✅ Storage is NOT a bottleneck
- 1 GB is massive for this use case
- Won't hit limit for 10+ years
- Monthly data cleanup not needed

### Connections (Estimated 10-20 Free)

**Current usage**: Default pool = 5 connections + 10 overflow = 15 max

**Risk**: Could hit limit with 20+ concurrent users

**Solution** (already implemented):
```python
pool_size=3,        # Reduce from 5
max_overflow=5,     # Reduce from 10
pool_recycle=3600   # Recycle hourly
```

### Expiration Risk ⚠️

Render PostgreSQL free tier expires if **not accessed for 90 days**.

**Mitigation**:
1. Set monthly calendar reminder to extend
2. Create backup script:
```bash
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

---

## What Needs to Happen for It to Work

### Mandatory Configuration

1. **✅ Use lightweight scheduler**
   ```env
   RENDER=true
   ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false
   ```
   - Automatically detected and enabled
   - Uses 2 sources instead of 6
   - ~400MB instead of 500+ MB

2. **✅ Set up keep-alive monitoring**
   - UptimeRobot (free)
   - Ping `/health` every 14 minutes
   - Prevents 15-minute auto-sleep

3. **✅ Configure connection pool**
   ```python
   pool_size=3
   max_overflow=5
   ```

4. **✅ Monthly database check**
   - Extend if approaching 90-day timeout
   - No manual cleanup needed (storage not an issue)

### Monitoring Requirements

5. **Track memory usage**
   - Render dashboard shows real-time metrics
   - Alert if exceeding 450MB (88% of limit)
   - Upgrade if hitting limit regularly

6. **Monitor for OOM kills**
   - Check Render logs for "OOM" or "memory" messages
   - If >1 per week, upgrade to paid tier

7. **Test under load**
   ```bash
   # Simulate traffic
   ab -n 1000 -c 20 https://api.onrender.com/events
   ```

## When to Upgrade

### Upgrade to Render $7/month ($0 → $7) if:

🚨 **Memory Issues**:
- Consistently hitting 450+ MB
- OOM kills more than once/week
- Need to run full 6-source pipeline

🚨 **Performance Issues**:
- Users complain about 5-15s latency
- High traffic (100+ users/day)

🚨 **Feature Requirements**:
- Need background scheduler
- Want full fact-checking pipeline
- Need faster response times

### Keep Free Tier if:

✅ **Low traffic** (<50 users/day)
✅ **MVP/Demo** (not production)
✅ **Can accept slowness** (5-15s during peak)
✅ **Limited data sources OK** (2 vs 6)
✅ **Manual oversight acceptable** (monthly check-in)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Address Before Launch)

🔴 **Backend memory at 117% of limit during pipeline**
- Mitigation: Use lightweight scheduler (included)
- Alternative: Disable background processing
- Monitor: Check memory in Render dashboard weekly

### Medium Risk (Monitor Closely)

🟡 **Cold start delays (30-60 seconds)**
- Mitigation: Keep-alive with UptimeRobot
- User impact: First request slow, others fast
- Acceptable for MVP

🟡 **Database connection pool exhaustion**
- Mitigation: Reduce pool size to 3+5=8
- Alternative: Use connection pooling service (PgBouncer)
- Risk: 429 errors with 20+ concurrent users

### Low Risk (Acceptable Trade-offs)

🟢 **Limited data sources (2 vs 6)**
- Mitigation: Full 6 sources on $7/month tier
- User impact: Fewer articles per event
- Acceptable for MVP

🟢 **Database expiration after 90 days**
- Mitigation: Monthly calendar reminder + backup
- User impact: None if extended monthly
- Acceptable with process
