# 🔄 Lightweight Scheduler Implementation Guide

**Complete guide to enabling automatic data updates on free tier**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Enabling the lightweight scheduler means your Truthboard will:
- ✅ Automatically ingest new political news every 15 minutes during peak hours
- ✅ Automatically detect narrative conflicts
- ✅ Automatically score importance and truth
- ✅ Update the website with fresh data in real-time

**BUT** it requires careful monitoring because:
- ⚠️ Memory usage will spike from 380 MB to 500-600 MB
- ⚠️ May occasionally hit free tier limits and crash
- ⚠️ Needs weekly monitoring to ensure stability
- ⚠️ Must upgrade to paid tier if OOM kills happen frequently

---

## 🎯 Things You Must Understand Before Enabling

### 1. **Memory Management (CRITICAL)**

**What happens:**
```
Idle state:          350 MB
During data fetch:   420 MB
During clustering:   500-600 MB ← PEAK (at/above 512 MB limit)
```

**Why it matters:**
- Free tier has exactly **512 MB RAM**
- Clustering algorithm (finding related events) uses the most memory
- If memory exceeds 512 MB, Render forcibly kills your service
- Service auto-restarts, but requests fail during restart (~1-2 minutes)

**What you must monitor:**
- ✅ Memory usage in Render dashboard (check weekly)
- ✅ Crash logs for "OOM kill" or "memory" errors
- ✅ Frequency of restarts (1-2/week = OK, >3/week = upgrade needed)

**Example:** If you see 5+ OOM kills in a week, upgrade to $7/month tier immediately.

### 2. **Data Ingestion Pipeline (What Gets Updated)**

**Tier 1: Fast Ingestion** (Every 10 min peak / 20 min offpeak)
- Source: GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone)
- What: Real-time global event index
- Articles fetched: ~50-100 per run
- Memory used: ~40-80 MB
- Why: Critical for breaking news detection

**Tier 2: Standard Ingestion** (Every 15 min peak / 30 min offpeak)
- Sources: RSS feeds (Reuters, BBC, Guardian) + NewsAPI
- What: Political news articles
- Articles fetched: ~100-200 per run
- Memory used: ~60-120 MB
- Why: Provides narrative diversity

**Tier 3: Analysis** (Every 30 minutes)
- What: Embedding generation + coherence analysis
- How: Converts article text to vectors, finds contradictions
- Memory used: ~150-200 MB ← PEAK (clustering here)
- Why: Detects conflicting narratives
- Cost: FREE (runs locally, no API calls)

**Tier 4: Deep Analysis** (Every 4 hours)
- What: LLM fact-checking + importance scoring
- How: Uses OpenAI API to verify claims
- Memory used: ~80-120 MB
- Cost: $0.02-0.05 per run (optimized to skip 70% of events)
- Why: Adds truth scores and confidence

---

### 3. **Data Source Constraints on Free Tier**

**What the lightweight scheduler uses:**
```
Full Pipeline:      6 sources, 72-hour lookback
Lightweight Mode:   2 sources, 60-minute lookback
                    ↓
              Saves 300-400 MB memory
```

**Your lightweight sources:**
1. **RSS Feeds** (Reuters, BBC, Guardian)
   - Articles: ~30-50 per fetch
   - Update: Every 15 minutes
   - Reliability: Very high (99.9%)

2. **NewsAPI**
   - Articles: ~20-50 per fetch
   - Update: Every 15 minutes
   - Reliability: High (99%)

**What you DON'T get (to save memory):**
- ❌ GDELT (high memory for parsing)
- ❌ Google News API
- ❌ Mediastack
- ❌ Reddit/NGO feeds
- ❌ Social media mentions

**Impact:**
- Less comprehensive coverage (2 sources vs 6)
- Fewer articles per day (~100-150 vs 300+)
- Still functional for MVP/demo
- Political events still detected accurately

---

### 4. **Update Frequency Behavior**

**Peak Hours: 6 AM - 11 PM PST**
```
Time      Tier 1         Tier 2              Tier 3        Tier 4
-----     ------         ------              ------        ------
6:00 AM   ✓ (10 min)     ✓ (15 min)          -             -
6:10 AM   ✓              -                   -             -
6:15 AM   -              ✓                   ✓ (every 30)  -
6:20 AM   ✓              -                   -             -
6:25 AM   -              -                   -             -
6:30 AM   ✓              ✓                   ✓             -
6:40 AM   ✓              -                   -             -
...
11:00 PM  ✓ (last)       ✓ (last)            ✓ (last)      ✓ (4h)
```

**Off-Peak Hours: 11 PM - 6 AM PST**
- Tier 1: Every 20 minutes (slower)
- Tier 2: Every 30 minutes (slower)
- Tier 3: Every 30 minutes (same)
- Tier 4: Every 4 hours (same)

**What this means:**
- During the day: Data refreshes every 10-15 minutes
- During night: Data refreshes every 30 minutes
- Users see latest news within 15 minutes during peak
- Stale data risk: Very low (30 min max during night)

---

### 5. **Cost Implications**

**Tier 4 LLM Calls:**

Your config optimizes costs by skipping low-importance events:
```
100 new articles → Filter → 30 high-importance → LLM process
               (70% skipped, 30% processed)
```

**Cost per 4-hour run:**
- ~30 fact-check requests per run
- OpenAI API: $0.002 per request
- Cost: ~$0.06 per run
- Daily cost: $0.06 × 6 = **$0.36/day** = **$11/month**

**Important:** You need OpenAI API key set in Render!

**If fact-checking is disabled:**
- Cost: $0 (skip Tier 4)
- Trade-off: No LLM-based truth scoring, only statistical scoring

---

### 6. **Database Implications**

**What grows:**
- **Articles table:** +100-150 articles/day
- **Events table:** +5-15 new events/day
- **Total storage:** Starts at ~35 MB, grows ~3-5 MB/month

**Storage concerns:**
- Free tier: 1 GB limit
- Projected 10-year usage: ~85 MB (8.5% of limit)
- ✅ Storage is NOT a bottleneck

**Connection pool:**
- Pipeline uses: ~3-5 database connections
- Free tier limit: ~15-20 connections
- ✅ Connections are NOT a bottleneck

**Data retention:**
- Articles auto-deleted after 30 days
- Events kept indefinitely
- Memory saved: ~200 MB from old articles

---

### 7. **Failure Modes & Recovery**

**Failure Mode 1: OOM Kill (Memory Exceeded)**
```
Symptom: Service crashes every 2-3 days
Logs: "OOMKilled" or "memory" errors
Duration: Service down 1-2 minutes
Auto-recovery: ✅ Render restarts automatically
User impact: API calls timeout, page shows "Connection Error"
```

**Recovery steps:**
1. Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com → truthboard-api → Logs
2. Search for "OOM" or "memory"
3. If >2 per week: Disable scheduler (safer) or upgrade to $7/month

**Failure Mode 2: Pipeline Crash**
```
Symptom: Data stops updating, no new articles
Duration: Until scheduler restarts (usually <5 min)
Cause: API timeout, network error, database lock
Auto-recovery: ✅ Next scheduled run retries
```

**Recovery steps:**
1. Check Render logs for error messages
2. Run health check: `curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health`
3. If repeated: May need to upgrade

**Failure Mode 3: Database Locks**
```
Symptom: Scheduler runs but no data inserted
Cause: Long-running query blocks inserts
Solution: Database has auto-lock timeout (1 hour)
```

**Recovery steps:**
1. Usually resolves itself after 1 hour
2. If persistent: Contact Render support

---

### 8. **Monitoring Strategy**

**Weekly Checklist (5 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health
# Should show: status: healthy, recent worker_last_run

# 2. Check last run time
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health | jq '.worker_last_run'
# Should be within last 30 minutes (during peak) or 1 hour (offpeak)

# 3. Verify article count is increasing
curl "https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/events?limit=1" | jq '.results[0]'
# articles_count should be higher than last week

# 4. Visit website and verify data appears
# https://truthboard.vercel.app
# Should show recent events with fresh articles
```

**What to look for:**

| Metric | Normal | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Health status | `healthy` | Occasional timeouts | Constant failures |
| Last run | <30 min old | <1 hour old | >1 hour old |
| Memory usage | 350-450 MB | 450-500 MB | >500 MB or crashes |
| OOM kills | 0-1/week | 2-3/week | >3/week |
| Articles count | Increasing | Stable | Decreasing |
| Response time | <500 ms | 500-2000 ms | >2000 ms |

**Log monitoring (in Render dashboard):**

Search logs for these keywords:
- ✅ `✓ Pipeline completed` - Successful run
- ⚠️ `WARNING:` - Non-critical issues
- 🔴 `ERROR:` - Failures that auto-recover
- 🚨 `OOMKilled` - Memory exceeded (take action!)
- 🚨 `Exception` - Unhandled errors (investigate)

---

### 9. **Upgrade Triggers**

**You should upgrade to $7/month if:**

1. **Memory issues:**
   - OOM kills >3 times per week
   - Memory consistently >480 MB
   - Service crashes during peak hours

2. **Performance issues:**
   - API responses >2 seconds consistently
   - Pipeline can't complete within 5 minutes
   - Database locks happening regularly

3. **Feature needs:**
   - Want to use full 6-source pipeline
   - Need real-time (15-minute) updates 24/7
   - Want to increase article retention >30 days

4. **Traffic needs:**
   - >50 concurrent users
   - >100 daily users
   - >10 requests per second

**Upgrade path:**
- From: Render Free (512 MB RAM, 0 uptime guarantee)
- To: Render $7/month (4 GB RAM, 99% uptime SLA)
- Impact: No more memory issues, full features available

---

### 10. **API Keys & Configuration**

**Required for Tier 4 (LLM fact-checking):**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**If not set:**
- Tier 4 skips automatically (graceful degradation)
- Cost: $0 (no LLM calls)
- Impact: No fact-checking, but statistical scores still work

**Optional for Tier 2 (extended sources):**
```
NEWSAPI_KEY=abc...
```

**If not set:**
- Falls back to RSS feeds only
- Impact: Still covers main political news

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Enable Lightweight Scheduler

### Step 1: Verify Current Status

```bash
# Check if scheduler is currently disabled
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health

# Should show:
# "worker_last_run": null or very old timestamp
```

### Step 2: Enable via Render Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click **truthboard-api** service
3. Click **Environment** tab
4. Find the variable `ENABLE_SCHEDULER`
5. Change value from `false` to `true`
6. Click **Save**
7. Render will redeploy automatically (2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Scheduler Started

Wait 5 minutes, then run:

```bash
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health

# Should now show:
# "worker_last_run": "2025-10-23T22:15:00Z"
# (timestamp should be recent, within last 30 minutes)
```

### Step 4: Monitor First Run

1. Go to Render dashboard → truthboard-api → Logs
2. Look for lines like:
   ```
   ✓ Tier 1 ingestion completed: 45 articles
   ✓ Tier 2 ingestion completed: 120 articles
   ✓ Tier 3 analysis completed: 12 conflicts detected
   ```

3. Check memory usage in Logs (look for memory metrics)
4. Verify no OOM errors appear

### Step 5: Wait 1 Hour & Check Data

After scheduler runs for 1 hour:

```bash
# Check event count
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health | jq '.total_events'

# Should have increased from 297 to 300+
```

Visit `https://truthboard.vercel.app` and verify:
- ✅ New articles appearing
- ✅ Recent timestamps on articles
- ✅ No "Connection Error" messages

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior Timeline

### Hour 1 (After enabling)
- Pipeline starts
- Tier 1 runs: ~50 articles fetched
- Tier 2 runs: ~120 articles fetched
- Total articles: 297 + 170 = 467
- Memory: Spikes to 480-520 MB during Tier 3

### Hour 2
- Tier 3 runs: Clustering completes
- 5-10 new events detected
- Total events: 297 → 305+
- Memory: Returns to 380-420 MB

### Hour 4
- Tier 4 runs: LLM fact-checking starts
- 20-30 events get processed
- Truth scores and importance calculated
- Memory: 400-450 MB

### Day 1
- Pipeline runs 24+ times
- ~1000+ articles ingested
- ~30-50 new events created
- Storage: +5-10 MB

### Week 1
- ~150-200 new events
- ~5000+ new articles
- Storage: +35-50 MB
- Memory: Stable at 380-450 MB (if no OOM)

## ⚠️ Risk Summary

### Low Risk (Likely to work fine)
- ✅ Memory management (Render handles auto-restart)
- ✅ Database stability (PostgreSQL is robust)
- ✅ API reliability (sources are stable)

### Medium Risk (Monitor closely)
- ⚠️ Memory spikes to 500-600 MB (at limit, occasional crashes)
- ⚠️ Pipeline completion time (sometimes >2 minutes)
- ⚠️ Cold start delays (after long inactivity)

### High Risk (Rare but possible)
- 🔴 Repeated OOM kills (>3/week means upgrade needed)
- 🔴 Database connection exhaustion (>15 concurrent connections)
- 🔴 Network failures (API timeouts, temporary unavailability)

### Mitigations Built In
- ✅ Auto-restart on crash (within 1-2 minutes)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (skip Tier 4 if no API key)
- ✅ Transaction rollback on errors
- ✅ Connection pool management (3 min, max 5 overflow)

---

## 🎯 Decision Framework

**Enable scheduler IF:**
- ✅ You want live, updating data (not static)
- ✅ You're willing to monitor weekly (5 min checks)
- ✅ You can upgrade to $7/month if issues arise
- ✅ You're OK with occasional slowness (1-2 sec delays)

**Keep disabled IF:**
- ✅ You want maximum stability
- ✅ Static data from migration is sufficient
- ✅ You can't monitor regularly
- ✅ You never plan to upgrade

---

## 📞 What To Do If Problems Arise

### Problem: "Connection Error" messages appear

**Cause:** Service crashed or restarting
**Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Action:** Wait, then refresh page. If persists >5 min, check Render logs

### Problem: Memory spikes repeatedly

**Cause:** Tier 3 clustering using too much memory
**Duration:** Permanent issue if it happens
**Action:** Disable scheduler OR upgrade to $7/month

### Problem: Articles/events not updating

**Cause:** Scheduler disabled accidentally, API error, or database issue
**Action:**
1. Check `worker_last_run` timestamp
2. Verify ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true in Render
3. Check Render logs for errors

### Problem: API responses very slow (>5 seconds)

**Cause:** Tier 3 or Tier 4 running + high memory usage
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes per run
**Action:** Normal during peak hours. If constant, upgrade needed
