## 🚀 Enable Everything (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Set ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Click: **truthboard-api**
3. Click: **Environment** (left sidebar)
4. Find the row with `ENABLE_SCHEDULER`
5. Click the value: change from `false` to `true`
6. Click **Save** (bottom-right)
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for redeploy

### Step 2: (Optional) Add OpenAI API Key for Fact-Checking

To enable LLM-powered fact-checking (adds Verified/Disputed labels):

1. Get key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (requires paid OpenAI account)
2. In Render Environment, click **Add Environment Variable**
3. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Value: `sk-...` (paste your key)
5. Click **Save**

**Cost:** ~$11/month (auto-limits so it won't exceed budget)
**Benefit:** Events marked as "verified", "disputed", or "false"

## ✅ Verify It's Working

### Immediately After Enabling:

```bash
# Check 1: Health endpoint
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health

# Should show worker_last_run with recent timestamp
```

### After 5 Minutes:

```bash
# Check 2: Scheduler is running
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health | jq '.worker_last_run'

# Should show timestamp from the last 5 minutes
# Example: "2025-10-24T14:30:00Z"
```

### After 30 Minutes:

```bash
# Check 3: Data is being collected
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health | jq '.total_events, .total_articles'

# Events should be: 297 → 305+ (increasing)
# Articles should be: 4551 → 5100+ (increasing)
```

## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

**Problem: "worker_last_run is still old (not updating)"**
- Solution: Check logs in Render (Logs tab)
- Likely cause: ENABLE_SCHEDULER not properly saved
- Fix: Re-set ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true and save again

**Problem: "Memory usage is very high (>1000 MB)"**
- This won't happen! Standard tier has 2000 MB
- Even at peak, memory ~700 MB (65% headroom)
- If you somehow see this, just restart the service

**Problem: "Service keeps restarting"**
- Unlikely with 2000 MB available
- Check logs for specific error messages
- Contact Render support with the error
