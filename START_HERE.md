## 🎯 Why "Last Update 14 Hours Ago"?

**This is NOT a problem.**

The scheduler was disabled locally (default setting). The timestamp shows when the scheduler last ran successfully (Oct 23, 4:42 PM UTC).

**Once you enable ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true on Render:**
- Scheduler starts running
- Data updates every 15 minutes
- Timestamp becomes recent
- Everything works automatically

## 🔍 Quick Verification

### Check Backend is Alive
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "total_events": 297,
  "total_articles": 4901
}
```

### Check Production Backend is Live
```bash
curl https://truthboard-api.onrender.com/health | jq '.'
```

Expected: Same output with worker_last_run timestamp

### Check Frontend Loads
Visit: https://truthboard.vercel.app

Expected: Page loads fast and displays data
