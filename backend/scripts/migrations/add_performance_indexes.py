"""Add composite indexes for performance optimization

Bottleneck Analysis:
1. N+1 queries on event listing pages
2. Slow queries on articles_raw table (multiple query patterns)
3. Event filtering by importance and confidence tier
4. Article filtering by source and ingestion time

These composite indexes optimize the most common query patterns
without adding significant storage overhead (~50MB for millions of rows).
